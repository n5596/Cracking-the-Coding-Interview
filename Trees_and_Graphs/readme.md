      min-max approach: easier to implement but it's a bit confusing. learn this for interviews.
      
      inorder approach: if we're not using a list to store the nodes in order, it's difficult to implement but the logic is simple

7. Build Order: https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/ (**)

      non-DFS: checking for all nodes with incoming[node] == 0 and adding them to a queue.
